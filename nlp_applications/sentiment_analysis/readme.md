Sentiment Analysis DNN code

- This code contains 
	- basic concept of buliding DNN for N21 problem ("TUTORIAL" purpose only)

	- application is sentiment anlaysis 

	- input sequence  : user sentence
	- output sequence : sentiment tags (POS, NEG, NEU, OBJ)

	- You can upgrade the model by
		- Attention mechanism

		- Convolutional Networks (esp. conv1d )
		- and many other techniques.
